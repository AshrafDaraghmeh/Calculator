This web project is a simple calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

The HTML code provided defines the structure of the calculator web page. It includes a form with buttons representing numbers and operators, as well as a display area for the calculations. The stylesheet (style.css) is used to define the visual appearance of the calculator.

The JavaScript code (main.js) defines two functions used for the calculator's functionality:
cal(num): This function is called when a number or operator button is clicked. It appends the clicked value to the input display area.
equal(): This function is called when the equals (=) button is clicked. It evaluates the expression entered in the input display area using the eval function and updates the display with the result.
